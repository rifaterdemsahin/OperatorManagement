To port forward in Minikube, you can use the `kubectl port-forward` command. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the service you want to port forward**:
    ```sh
    kubectl get svc
    ```

2. **Port forward the service**:
    ```sh
    kubectl port-forward svc/<service-name> <local-port>:<service-port>
    ```

For example, if you want to forward port 80 of a service named `grafana` to your local port 8080, you would use:
```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/grafana 8080:80
```

This command will forward traffic from your local port 8080 to port 80 of the `grafana` service running in your Minikube cluster[1](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/minikube-expose-port)[2](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/).

Great! It looks like your Grafana service is running on port 3000. To port forward this service to your local machine, you can use the following command:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-release-grafana-operator-grafana-service 8080:3000
```

This command will forward traffic from your local port 8080 to port 3000 of the `my-release-grafana-operator-grafana-service` service running in your Minikube cluster.
