The difference between the two commands lies in what they are trying to expose:

1. **Not Working:**
    ```bash
    kubectl expose service grafana-operator --type=NodePort --target-port=3000 --name=grafana-np
    ```
    This command attempts to expose a service named `grafana-operator`. The error message indicates that this service does not exist, which is why the command fails.

2. **Working:**
    ```bash
    kubectl expose deployment grafana-operator --type=NodePort --target-port=3000 --name=grafana-np
    ```
    This command exposes a deployment named `grafana-operator`. Since the deployment exists, the command works successfully.

### Why One Works and the Other Doesn't:
- **Service vs. Deployment:** 
  - A **service** in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them. If the service `grafana-operator` does not exist, the command to expose it will fail.
  - A **deployment** provides declarative updates to applications. It manages the creation and scaling of pods. Since you have a deployment named `grafana-operator`, exposing it works.

### Summary:
- Ensure you are exposing the correct resource type that exists in your cluster. In this case, `grafana-operator` is a deployment, not a service.
