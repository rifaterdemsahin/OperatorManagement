Got it! For Bitnami Grafana templates, the default username is typically **"user"** and the default password is **"bitnami"**. However, it's always a good idea to check the specific documentation or configuration files for your deployment, as these defaults can sometimes vary.

If you need help with anything else, just let me know!
